# Git Workshop

Welcome to the Stevens Blueprint community! This exercise is designed to help you get comfortable with using Git and GitHub, which are important tools for software development.

To get started run the following in your terminal:
``git clone https://github.com/stevensblueprint/blueprint_website.git``


For this exercise, you will need to complete three steps (Do steps 1-2 through CLI):

## 1. Create a New Branch 
Create a new branch from main using Git and name it "feature/[your name]" (i.e. "feature/ShawnAviles"). In a real-world scenario, a common best practice is for branch to be named after the specific feature being implemented, but for this exercise, we will keep it simple and just use your first and last name.

## 2. Commit your changes
Create an HTML file and commit it to your branch. You can choose the content of the HTML file, but make sure to include your name in it.

## 3. Make a Pull Request
3. Open a pull request to merge your branch into the main branch.

Congratulations, you have completed the exercise!
